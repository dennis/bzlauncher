- look at /usr/share/applications/opera.desktop for bzflag/bzlauncher protocol handler

- Column Class (name of an Attribute)
	- one exists for each column across views (eg. One for "Servername")
		- it contains info about positioning and if visible on both the list and details
		- and in list, if it the one the list is sorted by
		- Grouping information? Each ColumnClass belongs to a group?
			eg: Primary (default), which is preformatted
			eg: "BZStats" a list of name/value pairs, a lot like the server-details is now
			.. perhaps "Groups" should be tabs in server-details?
- Put all Attribute()'s into a map, with a ColumnClass* as key in Server
- Each DataSource got a map with key=name, and value = ColumnKey 
- DataSource.update() - updates the serverlist
	- Calls DataController.update("server:port", Attribute)
		- to update data.. If server:port dosnt exists, its added.
	- Calls DataController.delete("server:port")
		- to remove the server completly
- DataController - controls/owns the datalist and versioning info
	- Caches the data for quick load at next startup
