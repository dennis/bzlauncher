- BUG: Buggy ping. If GUI is busy, ping-measurement is off
- Search:
	- needs to support `name`
- "Ping" dosn't seem to work (it ignores it?)
- CTRL-W to close tab would be nice too
- protocol handlers. Start app and show "details"
	optionally:
		bzflag://dub.bzflag.org:5154?start 
		bzflag://dub.bzflag.org:5154?details
	default:
		bzlauncher://..
