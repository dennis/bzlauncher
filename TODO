- DataSource: Ping
- Sorting of QueryResult
- ServerDetails ("details")
	- Each DataSource got a DataSourceGUI class, to display the info?
- ServerActions (launch)
- Colorization of rows (empty, full, not-parsed.. etc) Let listserver decide
- Reload listserver-data
- Remove gone servers from list when listserver reloads
- Configuration: Remember to make sane defaults
- Favorites
- Recent
- Look at /usr/share/applications/opera.desktop for bzflag/bzlauncher protocol handler (under linux)
- DataController should store the list on exit, to be able to quickly show a list to the user, while it fetches the listserver data.
- Consider using $server, $text etc instead of server, text for the keys of the labels
	(can be used for searching, ie: $red > 2 (more than 2 reds)
	(eg: $ping < 100, will only show server that is playable :))
