- BUG: Buggy ping. If GUI is busy, ping-measurement is off
- BUG: Column width isnt properly stored/retrieved

- Search:
	- Each SearchQuery results in a ServerView, which is a subset of the ServerList
	- All SearchResults are marked as invalid when serverlist is refreshed. The query is 
	  re-executed to update the SearchResult
	- Implement a SearchQuery that parses the text and can be compared to the
	  servers in the serverlist.
	- Implement a ServerAttribute that contains the server-data (of different type). 
	- Each search is stored as a tab, and saved/stored on quit/launch
		when storing config save for each tab:
			tabnum=number-of-tabs
			tab0_sortmode=..
			tab0_query=ctf
	- Query parsing (ideas)
		Support AND + OR + NOT + Grouping... Needs more pondering
		Support `name` which will name the tab "name" instead of the query
- Recently played server view
	- indirectly via Search

- Use autotools
- protocol handlers. Start app and show "details"
	optionally:
		bzflag://dub.bzflag.org:5154?start 
		bzflag://dub.bzflag.org:5154?details
	default:
		bzlauncher://..
