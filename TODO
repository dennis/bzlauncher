- BUG: Buggy ping. If GUI is busy, ping-measurement is off
- look at /usr/share/applications/opera.desktop for bzflag/bzlauncher protocol handler

- Change Server class, so that all data is stored in Attribute<>
	- Create a GameStyle class, to represents the different flags
	- Add a Attribute.operator==(wxString token) used by Query
